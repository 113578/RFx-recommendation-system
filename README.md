# Tender-recommendation-system

This recommendation system recommends RFxs to suppliers based on their previous activity history and the RFx's item description using TF-IDF, LSA, and Annoy library concepts.

The project is mainly aimed at demonstrating my hard skills, rather than knowledge and insight into how tenders work in detail.
